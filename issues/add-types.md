# Add types
There is currently a types package in sigsum-log-go.  It should be moved over
here with the goal of being a small dependency for the log and future tooling.

Some steps that this issue involves:
- [ ] Determine what should (not) be in types package
- [ ] Import and refactor
- [ ] Increase test coverage
- [ ] Add missing functionality like verification of proofs, etc.
