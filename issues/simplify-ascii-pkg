The current ASCII package implements general key-value parsing for types.  It
is more complicated than it needs to be, especially since we have so few types.

Consider replacing the general ASCII package with something simpler.  For
example, just parse values into

	type Map map[string][]string

and add methods to dequeue a value for a key.  Each type could then extract its
own values without too much code duplication.
