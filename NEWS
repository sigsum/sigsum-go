NEWS for Sigsum tools, v0.11.0

	The main changes in this version are more efficient batch
	submissions as well as improved documentation for all tools.

	New features:

	* sigsum-submit: batch submissions are done more efficiently
	  underneath the hood (the UI of passing >1 input is the same).

	* sigsum tools: some short and long option names have been added,
	  e.g., "-a" is now the short option for "--token-signing-key".

	Bug fixes:

	* Fix so that the --quiet option cannot crash sigsum-token.

	Documentation improvements:

	* sigsum tools: all usage messages have been brushed up.

	* man pages: can be generated with `make doc`.  Depends on
	  help2man (cmd/*) and pandoc (doc/tools.md) being installed.

	Incompatible changes:

	* sigsum-submit: increase timeout from 45s to 10m.  There is a builtin
	  shorter timeout for individual log queries that is not configurable.
