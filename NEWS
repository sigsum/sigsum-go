NEWS for Sigsum tools, v0.13.1

	This is a bug fix release.

	Bug fixes:

	* Fix go.mod and go.sum files as needed after versions of
          x/net and x/text dependencies were changed.

NEWS for Sigsum tools, v0.13.0

	This release makes policy file format a bit stricter, and
	includes a first builtin policy using production logs and
	witnesses.

	Incompatible changes:

	* The Sigsum policy format has been made a bit stricter,
	  rejecting duplicates, rejecting control characters, and
	  requiring that comments start at the beginning of a line.
	  See updated doc/sigsum-proof.md. For motivation, see
	  https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/proposals/2025-10-stricter-policy-format.md

	New policies:

	* This version includes a new builtin trust policy named
	  "sigsum-generic-2025-1". This is the first builtin policy
	  that uses production logs and witnesses. For a description
	  of the procedure used maintain builtin named policies, see
	  https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/policy-maintenance.md

	Bug fixes:

	* Make Endpoint.Path not produce request URLs with double '/'
	  separators. See
	  https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/log-go/-/issues/129.

	Miscellaneous:

	* The primary supported go toolchain version is now 1.24.
	  Using go-1.23 is still supported and tested. Using later
	  versions is also expected to work, but is not tested.

NEWS for Sigsum tools, v0.12.0

	The main change in this release is support for named policies.

	New features:

	* Support for named policies. This means that the user can
	  optionally specify a policy name (using the -P option or
	  directly in submitter key file) instead of specifying a
	  policy file.

	* Support for builtin policies. In this version there are two
	  builtin policies called "sigsum-test1-2025" and
	  "sigsum-test2-2025".

	* New tool "sigsum-policy" that can be used to list and show
	  available named policies.

	Documentation improvements:

	* In doc/sigsum-proof.md, document the correct keyword "size",
	  https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/sigsum-go/-/issues/135,
	  and clarify the description of how to compute the leaf hash.

	Incompatible changes:

	* Building now requires go version 1.23 or later.

NEWS for Sigsum tools, v0.11.2

	This release fixes yet another manpage date nit.

	Bug fixes:

	* Fix so that make doc works for signed git tags.

NEWS for Sigsum tools, v0.11.1

	This release fixes manpage nits found during Debian packaging.

	* Fix typos in usage messages and manpages.
	* Fix s/--verbose/--quiet/ in NEWS entry for v0.11.0.

	Incompatible changes:

	* Move sigsum-tools manpage from section 5 to section 7.

NEWS for Sigsum tools, v0.11.0

	The main changes in this version are more efficient batch
	submissions as well as improved documentation for all tools.

	New features:

	* sigsum-submit: batch submissions are done more efficiently
	  underneath the hood (the UI of passing >1 input is the same).

	* sigsum tools: some short and long option names have been added,
	  e.g., "-a" is now the short option for "--token-signing-key".

	Bug fixes:

	* Fix so that the --quiet option cannot crash sigsum-token.

	Documentation improvements:

	* sigsum tools: all usage messages have been brushed up.

	* man pages: can be generated with `make doc`.  Depends on
	  help2man (cmd/*) and pandoc (doc/tools.md) being installed.

	Incompatible changes:

	* sigsum-submit: increase timeout from 45s to 10m.  There is a builtin
	  shorter timeout for individual log queries that is not configurable.

NEWS for Sigsum tools, v0.10.1
